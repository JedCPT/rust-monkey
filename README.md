This repository includes an implementation of the interpreted Rust-Monkey programming language.
Rust-Monkey loosely follows the standard described in *Writing An Interpreter In Go* by Thorsten Ball ([link](https://interpreterbook.com)). 

A simple example of the Rust-Monkey langauge computing the n-th Fibonacci number is shown in fib.rm.
