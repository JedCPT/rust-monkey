Rust-Monkey is an interpreted programming language loosely based upon the specification of the Monkey programming language described in *Writing An Interpreter In Go* by Thorsten Ball ([link](https://interpreterbook.com)). 

This repository includes an Rust implementation of the Monkey programming language called Rust-Monkey.  

A simple example of the Rust-Monkey language in action computing the n-th Fibonacci number is shown in fib.rm.
